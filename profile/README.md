# Estallidos: Multifaced study of star-formation in the Universe
[ESTALLIDOS](https://research.iac.es/proyecto/estallidos2/) is a coordinated project between several Spanish research centers to study the formation and evolution of outbursts of star formation.

The project is aimed at studying massive starbursts and their impact on galaxies, using both observational and theoretical tools. We observe starbursts and model the physical processes that are involved, 
paying particular attention to the feedback on the surroundings that quenches or stimulates the formation of successive generations of stars.

Estallidos is organized and coordinated through  workshops in which ongoing work is discussed and new results are presented. They are attended by a significant part of the Estallidos community (currently around 60 people) and help to maintain strong scientific bounds and close collaborations.
